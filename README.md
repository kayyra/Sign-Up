ðŸš€ Today marks the start of my 100 day challenge with #Figma! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

ðŸ’¡ Every day for the next 100 days, I will be immersed in the world of design with Figma

ðŸŒŸ Day 1 Everything ready!

My first challenge was that we had to create a registration form for an event, exhibition, etc. In my case it was a form for a live classical music event.
